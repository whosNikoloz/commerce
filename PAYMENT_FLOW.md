# Complete E-Commerce Payment Flow

## 🛒 Full Payment Journey

### Step-by-Step Flow

```
1. User adds items to cart
   ↓
2. User clicks "Checkout"
   ↓
3. User fills shipping/billing info
   ↓
4. User selects payment provider (BOG or TBC)
   ↓
5. User clicks "Pay Securely"
   ↓
6. Frontend creates payment via backend API
   ↓
7. User redirected to Bank Payment Page (BOG/TBC)
   ↓
8. User completes payment on bank website
   ↓
9. Bank redirects back to /payment/callback
   ↓
10. Callback page checks payment status
    ↓
    ├─ SUCCESS → /checkout/success
    └─ FAILED → /checkout/failed
```

## 📄 Pages in the Flow

### 1. **Cart Page** (`/cart`)
- Shows cart items
- "Proceed to Checkout" button
- **Next:** `/cart/checkout`

### 2. **Checkout Page** (`/cart/checkout`)
**File:** `components/Cart/CheckoutPage/checkout-page.tsx`

**What happens:**
1. User fills:
   - Contact info (name, email, phone)
   - Shipping address
   - Billing address
   - Payment provider selection (BOG or TBC)

2. When user clicks "Pay Securely":
   ```typescript
   // For BOG
   POST /api/payment/bog/create
   → Returns: { orderId, redirectUrl }

   // For TBC
   POST /api/payment/tbc/create
   → Returns: { paymentId, redirectUrl }
   ```

3. User redirected to `redirectUrl` (bank website)

**Return URL set:** `/payment/callback?provider=bog` or `/payment/callback?provider=tbc`

### 3. **Bank Payment Page** (External - BOG/TBC)
- **BOG:** `https://ipay.ge/...`
- **TBC:** `https://api.tbcbank.ge/...`

**What user sees:**
- Bank's secure payment form
- Card number input
- CVV, expiry date
- 3D Secure verification (if required)

**After payment:**
- Bank redirects to your `returnUrl`
- Bank also sends webhook to `/api/payment/bog/callback` or `/api/payment/tbc/callback`

### 4. **Payment Callback Page** (`/payment/callback`)
**File:** `app/payment/callback/page.tsx`

**What happens:**
1. Page receives provider (bog/tbc) from URL
2. Shows "Processing payment..." with spinner
3. Fetches payment status:
   - TBC: `GET /api/payment/tbc/status/{paymentId}`
   - BOG: `GET /api/payment/bog/status/{orderId}`

4. Checks status every 3 seconds (polling)
5. For TBC: Also connects to SignalR for real-time updates

6. **If SUCCEEDED/COMPLETED:**
   - Shows success checkmark
   - Redirects to `/checkout/success` after 2 seconds

7. **If FAILED/CANCELLED:**
   - Shows error icon
   - Redirects to `/checkout/failed` after 2 seconds

8. **If PENDING:**
   - Keeps checking status
   - Shows "Payment is being processed..."

### 5. **Success Page** (`/checkout/success`)
**File:** `app/checkout/success/page.tsx`

**What user sees:**
- ✅ Green checkmark
- "Payment Successful!" message
- Order ID and Payment ID
- "Confirmation email will be sent" notice
- Buttons:
  - "Continue Shopping" → `/`
  - "View My Orders" → `/orders`

**What happens:**
- Clears `sessionStorage.lastOrderId`
- Shows order confirmation

### 6. **Failed Page** (`/checkout/failed`)
**File:** `app/checkout/failed/page.tsx`

**What user sees:**
- ❌ Red X icon
- "Payment Failed" message
- Reason for failure (if available)
- Common issues list
- Buttons:
  - "Try Again" → `/cart/checkout`
  - "Back to Cart" → `/cart`
  - "Continue Shopping" → `/`
  - "Contact Support" link

## 🔄 Backend Webhook Flow (Parallel)

While user is on callback page, backend receives webhook:

```
Bank sends webhook
    ↓
/api/payment/tbc/callback (POST)
or
/api/payment/bog/callback (POST)
    ↓
Backend fetches payment details from bank
    ↓
Backend updates order in database
    ↓
    ├─ markOrderComplete()
    └─ markOrderFailed()
    ↓
SignalR notification sent (TBC only)
    ↓
Frontend receives real-time update
```

   ```

5. **On bank page:**

   - Complete payment
   ```

6. **After payment:**
   ```

   → After 2 seconds → /checkout/success
   ```

7. **Success page:**
   ```

   → Can click "Continue Shopping" or "View Orders"
   ```

### Test Failure Flow

On bank payment page, click "Cancel" or use invalid card:
```
Bank page → Cancel
    ↓
/payment/callback (shows error)
    ↓
/checkout/failed
    ↓
Can click "Try Again" to retry
```

## 🚨 Error Handling

### If user closes browser during payment
- Payment may still be processing
- Backend webhook will update order status
- User can check order status in "/orders" page

### If callback page fails to load
- Backend webhook still processes payment
- User can refresh callback page
- Or visit "/orders" to see order status

### If SignalR fails (TBC only)
- System falls back to polling (checks every 3 seconds)
- User still gets payment status
- Just takes a bit longer

## 📱 Mobile Flow

Same flow works on mobile:
1. Mobile-responsive checkout form
2. Redirect to mobile bank payment page
3. Return to mobile callback page
4. Show mobile-optimized success/failure page
